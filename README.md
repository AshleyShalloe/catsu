# Catsu - CAT control for the Yaesu FT-991a

## What's this?

Yaesu do not provide CAT control software for the FT-991a, which is incredibly annoying. Nevertheless, they do at least provide complete documentation
of the entire set of CAT commands and parameters for reading from, writing to and controlling the transceiver.

We're trying to implement programming the memory banks because doing this from the front panel sucks, but we'll get there eventually.

As for right now, we're just implementing some baseline commands to prove that we can interact at all.
